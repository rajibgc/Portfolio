  <summary>CyberSecurity tools</summary>
  
  SIEM tools (Security Information & Event Mgt): for collection, analysis & alerting, but not for responding to contain a threat when an incident occurs.  
     - Splunk Enterprise (for internally hosted) | Splunk Cloud (for cloud hosted - managed by Splunk themselves/SaaS)
     - Chronicle (by Google)
     - Microsoft Sentinel (erstwhile Azure Sentinel)
  
  SOAR tools (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response): for automated response (typically containment measures when an incident occurs)
     - Microsoft Sentinel (erstwhile Azure Sentinel)
     - IBM QRadar
     - Splunk SOAR
     - Exabeam
     - Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR,
     - Chronicle SOAR
     - Fortinet FortiSOAR
     - Trellix ePolicy Orchestrator

  IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Could be Host-based or Network-based. Examples are: Suricata, SolarWinds, Splunk, AlienVault OSSIM, Snort, Zeek, IBM QRadar, Security Onion,Open WIPS-NG, Sagan.

  How is IDS different from SIEM? IDS covers the Security Event Management part of SIEM - i.e. focussed only on examining live network traffic (but not on saved log data).
  
  IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): Examples are: Cisco Secure Firewall, TrendMicro TippingPoint, McAfee, Trellix, AlertLogic MDR, SecurityOnion, Palo Alto Networks Threat Prevention, Suricata, Snort, OSSEC, Zeek, Sagan.
